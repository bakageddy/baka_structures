* AVL Tree:
** Height:
    Height of a node x in a tree is:
    h(x) = max(h(x -> left), h(x -> right)) + 1
    h(singleNode) = 0
    h(emptyNode) = -1


** Balance:
    Balance Factor of a node x:
    B(x) = H(l) - H(r)

    We have to make sure that the tree must be balanced, by ensuring that the
    | B(x)   | <= 1 |

** Rotations:
    We can rotate the nodes in a AVL Tree by maintaining the bst search property
    and ensure that the search complexity is O(logN)
